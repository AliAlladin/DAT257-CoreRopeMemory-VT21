Currently teaching assistants have to fill in pdfs at the end of each month documenting how many hours they have worked. 
This document is passed on to be accepted before the salary can be paid. The scope of the project is to develop a platform 
which can act as a common ground and make it easier for TAs to log their working hours. 

The application will be developed together with a TA from Chalmers who sees the need for digitization of the whole process.
