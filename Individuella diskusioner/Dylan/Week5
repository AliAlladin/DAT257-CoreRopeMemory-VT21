what do I want to learn or understand better?
I will be looking into spring security which is a tool for handling log in and registration which may come handy in the upcoming weeks.


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Taking part in discusions and try to share what I know is if course a good way to do it. I will also continue to share links to videos and other recourses which are 
good for learning tools.


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I was active in the sprint planning and helped the team plan what to do this week. I also helped some other members when they got stuck so they could continue with their user 
stories and tasks.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I couldnt take part in the sprint review and team reflection but I did write my thoguths on some of the topics which were discussed by the group on the meeting.
Other than that I was implementing the database and connecting it to the application together with Ali.
