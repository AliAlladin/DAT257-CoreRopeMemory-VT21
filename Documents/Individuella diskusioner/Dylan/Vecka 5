what do I want to learn or understand better?
Again, I want to try to look into spring security so that we can implement a login and registration system which is a feature that our stakeholder has told us will 
be interesting in the near future

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Same as last couple of weeks, not sure what more I can do to help the team learn something new. Maybe by discussing and explaining more in depth of what I have done during the sprint
will help them understand the framework and our codebase better. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I contibuted by together with the rest of the group by putting together the sprint backlog  and taking part in the sprint planning.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Implemented overtime, totalhour and salary calculations together with Samuel. Also took part in our meetings including the sprint review and the team reflection.
